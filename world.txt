# Lines beginning with '#' are comments, and are ignored along with empty
#   lines. Note that the line must BEGIN with a '#', meaning NO OTHER
#   CHARACTERS, even whitespace, can precede the '#' for it to be treated
#   as a comment line.
#
# Each object in the world is specified by an object definition, in the
#   form of a pseudo-JSON object. The object's type comes first, then an
#   opening curly bracket. Next come the attributes, and finally a closing
#   curly bracket.
#
# A quad object is given the type name 'Quad'. Immediately after the opening
#   curly bracket, 3 triples of numbers must appear. Afterwards, any
#   applicable named attributes may be listed.
#
# A point light object is given the type name 'PointLight'. Immediately
#   after the opening curly bracket, 1 number triple must appear; then the
#   applicable named attributes.
#
#
# Valid type names
#   'Quad'
#   'PointLight'
#
# Valid named attributes
#   'colour' or 'color'
#       3 space-separated hexidecimal numbers between 0 and 255.
