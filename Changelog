Version 0.2.0 -- File input.

* Changelog: Removed an erroneous reference to a Makefile being created.
* world.txt: Added.

* src/parser.py: Added.
(parse): Added. Parses the given file-like object.

* src/quad.py: Added.
(Quad): Added. Supports item retrieval. Item assignment raises a TypeError, as
Quads should be immutable.

* src/trace.py (main): Optional 1st command-line argument is the input
filename, and the optional 2nd command-line argument is the output filename.
The input file is parsed to get the world, instead of having a hardcoded array
of quads.
